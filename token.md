token registry

ad chain

nodes verify that the tokens are connected before

registered users can vote on the users/nodes of the list

the token is sold at a curve

this can be a reputation system or other voting things


intermediaries

    can be in two registrys, larger providers and nodes

DAICO, use token registry and use the gap between the token registry. Since we are early adopters we have cheaper coins and we can sell to the original smart contract since it has a price curve/ a higher price.
